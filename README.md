# Exploring Weather Data

While on vacation in Hawaii our client has decided to invest in a foolproof idea to keep you in Hawaii.  Surf n' Shake shop will serve surfboards and ice creams to locals, tourists, and the like.  The initial investment will be obtained from Savings but the client needs some initial analysis to help attract some real investor backing in order to get off the ground.  Our client has already put together a business plan and reached to the investors, but the main investors concern is the weather.  In order to proceed we need to provide weather analysis for temperature and pariticpation as this is the biggest concern of the investors.

## Summary

Overall based on the analysis, the company has made some very important first steps to making sure they are covered or future-proofing positions that otherwise may go unfilled.  Especially with the boomers wrapping up their retirment boom, it is extra important that the company stay vigilate and proactive to recruiting and/or moving people into mentorship programs BEFORE the current talent is no longer working.
