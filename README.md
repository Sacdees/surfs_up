# Exploring Weather Data

While on vacation in Hawaii our client has decided to invest in a foolproof idea to keep you in Hawaii.  Surf n' Shake shop will serve surfboards and ice creams to locals, tourists, and the like.  The initial investment will be obtained from Savings but the client needs some initial analysis to help attract some real investor backing in order to get off the ground.  Our client has already put together a business plan and reached to the investors, but the main investors concern is the weather.  In order to proceed we need to provide weather analysis for temperature and pariticpation as this is the biggest concern of the investors.
