# Exploring Weather Data

While on vacation in Hawaii our client has decided to invest in a foolproof idea to keep you in Hawaii.  Surf n' Shake shop will serve surfboards and ice creams to locals, tourists, and the like.  The initial investment will be obtained from Savings but the client needs some initial analysis to help attract some real investor backing in order to get off the ground.  Our client has already put together a business plan and reached to the investors, but the main investors concern is the weather.  In order to proceed we need to provide weather analysis for temperature and pariticpation as this is the biggest concern of the investors.



## Results

The first part of the project was to locate the existing employees that are ready for retirement.  Upon first look we were able to query a result depicted by the image below, more detailed information can be found in the data file under 'retirement_titles', but as you see at first look this initial request leaves a lot of duplicate data that can clog up and use too much space for our client.

Below you can find that we elimated duplicate entries.  As you may expect many of the employees that could retire, have probably also held multiple positions within the company.  This unique_titles query lists the employees by their final position and can then be categorized more effectively.

In an effort to assist with further planning of a retirement boom, we categorized the titles for each segment to get an idea of how many potential employees will be elgible and or retirement eliglble per department.

We were also able to produce some data for potential mentorship candidates.  With the high level of retirement eligeble canidates, it is very important to stay ahead of the curve and the image below depicts the potential employees that can replace those positions.

## Summary

Overall based on the analysis, the company has made some very important first steps to making sure they are covered or future-proofing positions that otherwise may go unfilled.  Especially with the boomers wrapping up their retirment boom, it is extra important that the company stay vigilate and proactive to recruiting and/or moving people into mentorship programs BEFORE the current talent is no longer working.
